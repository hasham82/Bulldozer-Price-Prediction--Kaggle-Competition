BULLDOZER PRICE PREDICTION

For this project, I worked on an end-to-end machine learning regression model to predict the price of bulldozers using structured data. The dataset came from the Bluebook for Bulldozers competition on Kaggle, which provides historical sales data for bulldozers. The goal was to build a model that could accurately estimate the future auction sale price of a bulldozer based on various features like equipment type, usage, and sale date.

I started by performing data preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting categorical features into numerical representations, and engineering new features such as extracting date-related information. I then explored different machine learning models, primarily using Scikit-Learn's Random Forest Regressor, to train and evaluate the model. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize performance.

To assess the model's accuracy, I used Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) as the evaluation metric, ensuring that the model performed well across a wide range of bulldozer prices. Finally, I deployed the model in a Jupyter Notebook, visualizing key insights and performance metrics to make data-driven improvements.

This project helped me enhance my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, reinforcing my understanding of regression techniques and structured data processing in real-world applications.
